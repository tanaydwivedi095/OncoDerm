# Streamlit-UI-for-Skin-Cancer-Predictions
Built a webpage using the Python Library called Streamlit. The webpage provides a UI to the client to interact with the machine learning algorithm to make predictions according to the pretrained model. The client may create any combination of the algorithms to make predictions.

The Model will be requiring h5 and pkl files to execute to download those use this link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZNjcluKK7dDyQ7NhVVcKOy7VKnYq0z7d?usp=sharing)
